# Bayes_SEM
R code for implementing the methods relating to: INSERT_LINK

The paper considers sequential Bayesian inference for S(E)IR model parameters and latent cumulative incidence process given noisy observations. A sequential inference scheme is developed, making use of a computationally cheap approximation of the most natural Markov process model with a novel bridge construct for propagating state trajectories conditional on the next observation. The developed scheme also allows for stochastic infection and reporting rates to be implemented.

The code can be used to reproduce the analysis for the applications.
